Netgear WNR3500L v1 Setup 

IMPORTANT NOTE - RTL-SDR DIDN'T WORK IN THIS SETUP.  Program runs 
but doesn't find any usb devices.  Suspect problem with kernel drivers
or libusb-1.0. Attempted to recompile libusb-1.0 from source but got
same result with versions 08, 09, and 17.

Use WNR3500L DD-WRT web interface to configure basic settings including 

1) Prepare a usb thumb drive to use for /opt and /jffs automounts

Create three partitions (assumes 1GB flash size)

Partition 1 - Type: ext2  Label: Opt   Size: 600MB
Partition 2 - Type: ext2  Label: Jffs  Size: 250MB
Partition 1 - Type: ext2  Label: Swap  Size: 191MB (remainder)

(Note that labels must be exactly as shown for automounting to work)


2)  Install DD-WRT Kong build that fits within 8MB device flash

With factory firmware, need to install .chk tail image first before you
can install the .bin kong build (google for instructions)

      usb-ftp-samba3-vpn-nv32k-broadcom.bin

3) Configure basic router settings including enabling USB, and SSHd

4) Create a samba share to transfer files to router

5) SSH to router

a) Install libusb-1.0

opkg update
opkg install libusb-1.0

b) Install lighttpd
opkg install lighttpd
opkg install lighttpd-mod-cgi

edit /opt/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
(These will be in the file already but need to be uncommented and/or edited)
- Uncomment mod_cgi in servicer modules section
- set: server.document-root = "/opt/rtl-wx/www"
- set: index-file.names = ( "index.cgi" )
- set: server.port = 81 (MUST NOT BE SAME PORT AS DD-WRT WEB INTERFACE)
- set: cgi.assign = ( ".cgi" => "" )

Instructions for getting WNR3500L compatible toolchain for cross compiling

get dd-wrt toolchain file (giant 1.5+ gig file with many toolchains)
extract toolchain-mipsel_gcc4.1.2 to ububtu/home

2) Build binaries of the usb-1.0 library for linking only (these aren't used on the R7000)

I tried to use the  usb-1.0 library from the R7000 (downloaded with opkg) but the linker complained
about the library not having any symbols, so I found the usb-1.0 sources and rebuilt them using the
cross-tools so the link would succeed.

cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libusb/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.9/libusb-1.0.9.tar.bz2
tar -xf libusb-1.0.9.tar.bz2
cd libusb-1.0.9
export TOOLCHAIN=/home/ubuntu/toolchain-mipsel_gcc4.1.2
export PATH="$TOOLCHAIN/bin/:$PATH"
./configure --prefix=/ --host=mipsel-linux
make
sudo make DESTDIR=$TOOLCHAIN install
