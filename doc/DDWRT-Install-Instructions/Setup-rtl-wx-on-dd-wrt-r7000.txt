Setup rtl-wx on Netgear R7000 running DD-WRT
--------------------------------------------

Requirements:

- Free USB port and compatible usb rtl-sdr device
- One or more supported Oregon Scientific 433mhz weather sensors
   eg THGR810, THGR122N, RGR968, BTHR968, THGR968
- SSH access to router
- writable /jffs and /opt (either with mounted USB drive or JFFS2)
  (rtl-wx package needs less than 10MB total disk space)
- ipkg and opkg working (needed to get libusb-1.0)
- Cross development toolchain on linux computer (for routers other than R7000)

Test Setup: 
- Netgear R7000 running DD-WRT v24-sp2 (06/06/14) kongac 
- NooElec USB-RTL-SDR dongle in rear usb port (usb 2.0)
- Sandisk 1GB usb thumb drive in front usb port (mounted to /opt and /jffs)

Note: For some reason, the blue light on the rtl-sdr dongle doesn't illuminate
      when plugged into the R7000, but otherwise it seems to work fine.


1) Install libusb-1.0 using: opkg install libusb-1.0

2) Copy rtl-wx folder to /opt on target plaform
   - For DD-WRT hardware other than Netgear R7000, you'll probably need
     to cross compile sources (see cross compile instructions).  The R7000
     binaries may work on Netgear R6xxx hardware.

3) Enable lighttpd web server
   - Use R7000 web interface to enable lighttpd
   - copy /tmp/lighttpd.conf to /jffs/etc
   - Edit lighttpd.conf as follows: (see example lighttpd.conf in this folder)
	edit server.dir-listing  "disable"
	edit server.indexfiles line to include only "index.cgi"
	add following line:  cgi.assign = ( ".cgi" => "" )
	edit server.document-root  = "/opt/rtl-wx/www" (or make link at /jffs/www)
	remove: server.bind = "192.168.x.x" (*optional)
	remove: "fast-cgi", from services (to save memory)
   - Restart lighttpd
	ps | grep lighttpd 
	kill proc#
	cd /jffs/etc
	lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf

4) Test program from command line in standalone mode
	cd /opt/rtl-wx/bin
	./rtl-wx -s
        (hit space bar for dump of weather data)

	alternatively, run ./rtl-433 for raw output from the USB_SDR dongle and for debugging

5) Review program documentation to customize

   Review rtl-wx/www/rtl-wx.conf and make changes as needed
   Edit rtl-wx/www/rtl-wx.htx 

6) Use R7000 web interface to add startup command: 

   /opt/rtl-wx/bin/rtl-wx -w /opt/rtl-wx/www &
