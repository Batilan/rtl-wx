Cross-build rtl-wx for the Netgear R7000 Router running dd-wrt
--------------------------------------------------------------

The rtl-wx distribution includes a binary for the R7000, so you shouldn't need to recompile unless you want to make changes to source code.

The DD-WRT environment on the R7000 doesn't have a native compiler so a cross-development toolchain is required. The steps below were done on Windows 7 using VirtualBox software running Ubuntu 14.04 in a 2GB Ram and 12GB virtual HDD virtual machine. The VM used was an out of the box base Ubuntu 14.04 install.

Note: If Ubuntu can't see windows shares, add a second network adapter in VirtualBox and set type to Bridged Adapter (maybe also set promiscuious mode allow all?)

1) Copy the R7000 open-wrt toolchain to linux system

The toolchain binaries work on an x86 processor in a linux environment. Download
and expand the toolchain folder somewhere with greater than 550MB of disk space. 

Get the toolchain binaries from here?
ftp://bo.mirror.garr.it/pub/1/openwrt/snapshots/trunk/bcm53xx/OpenWrt-Toolchain-bcm53xx-for-arm_cortex-a9-gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2_eabi.tar.bz2


2) Build libusb-1.0 on ubuntu (using cross tools)

(I tried to save time and copy libusb-1.0 binary from the R7000 (from opkg) but I got a link error so had to cross compile it even though I still used the actual library from opkg on the R7000, which worked fine)

cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libusb/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.9/libusb-1.0.9.tar.bz2
tar -xf libusb-1.0.9.tar.bz2
cd libusb-1.0.9
export TOOLCHAIN=/home/ubuntu/arm-toolchain
export PATH="$TOOLCHAIN/bin/:$PATH"
./configure --prefix=/ --host=arm-openwrt-linux

*** KLUDGE - Edit config.h to set #define HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY 1
             Do a chmod -w config.h to prevent configure from overwriting it.
             (without this, library has undefined external refrence that shows up in main link)

make
sudo make DESTDIR=$TOOLCHAIN install


3) Expand/copy rtl-wx folder to ubuntu home folder

4) Download and build librtlsdr in rtl-wx/src/librtlsdr

cd ~
wget https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr/archive/v0.5.3.tar.gz
tar -xvf v0.5.3.tar.gz
rm -r rtl-wx/src/librtlsdr
mv librtlsdr-0.5.3 rtl-wx/src/librtlsdr
cd rtl-wx/src/librtlsdr
cp ~/rtl-wx/doc/DDWRT-Instructions/toolchain.cmake .
mkdir build
cd build
export STAGING_DIR=.
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake ../
make
cd ~/rtl-wx/src

edit Makefile to uncomment variable definitions for R7000 and comment out any definitions for other platforms
make clean 
make
